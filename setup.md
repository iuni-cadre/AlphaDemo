## The Alpha Release

CADRE’s Alpha Release (Version 0.1.0-alpha) means users can begin working with Microsoft Academic Graph and using CADRE’s many features at no cost. CADRE’s sponsoring partners will have access to an additional paid-tier of service and content (Web of Science).

At today’s CADRE workshop, attendees will learn how to work with all of the CADRE features available to them in the alpha version of the platform, such as how to:

- Access open Microsoft Academic Graph datasets (or Web of Science for certain users)
- Query datasets with the CADRE Query Builder, CADRE’s user-friendly GUI query builder
- Code data-analysis and visualization tools in Jupyter Notebook
- Create a private space to store query outputs, data-analysis tools, and research results 
- Reproduce queries, data-analysis tools, derived data, research results, workflows, and visualizations in the Marketplace
- Reproduce analysis or visualizations shared by other researchers in the RAC Marketplace (public sharing of user code/data will be enabled later)

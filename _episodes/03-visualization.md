title: "Demo02: Networks and visualizations (Silva)"
teaching: 25
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can you build networks from query results and visualize them"
objectives:
- "Demonstrate word cloud visualizations."
- "Demonstrate network visualizations."
- "Explain how you can reproduce the result using public tools, with your own data"
- "Demonstrate advanced intreactive visualizations"
keypoints:
- Visualize prepared data query data in notebook
- Visualize your query data without coding
- Refine your query for better visualizations

> ## Getting Started
>- Start your Jupyter Notebook from https://cadre.iu.edu/gateway/jupyter
>- To get the input files in the right path, run the "demo02_data_package" from the CADRE Marketplace. https://cadre.iu.edu/gateway/rac
{: .prereq}

***
The first notebook illustrates how to bring scalable computing resources to the CADRE notebook environment. The notebook requres external credentals and will not be reproducible for the audience. 
```
Notebook: Non-interactive/2nd-degree-analysis.ipynb
```

* Input files: "/packages/issi_data_package/output_files/data/774e7eb6-6ac7-4dd5-9339-531b746cb8ec.csv"

* Output files: "/packages/issi_data_package/output_files/data/2ndOrderEdges.csv" 
```
To get the outputfiles, run the "ISSI Data Package" from the CADRE Marketplace.
```
We will illustrate how to generate edge lists from large citation data set using distributed cluster and the result is delivered through the "ISSI Data Package".
***

> ## Data set limitation
>- Only Microsoft Academic Graph data is compatible with this demo
>- Refine your query size for better visulization results (only papers after 2017 will be included for size control)

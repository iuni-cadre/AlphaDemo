title: "Demo02: Networks and visualizations (Silva)"
teaching: 30
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can you build networks from query results and visualize them"
objectives:
- "Demonstrate word cloud visualizations."
- "Demonstrate network visualizations."
- "Explain how you can reproduce the result using public tools, with your own data"
- "Demonstrate advanced intreactive visualizations"
keypoints:
- Visualize prepared data query data in notebook
- Visualize your query data without coding
- Refine your query for better visualizations

> ## Getting Started
>- Start your Jupyter Notebook from [https://cadre.iu.edu/gateway/jupyter](https://cadre.iu.edu/gateway/jupyter)
>- To get the input files in the right path, run the "demo02_data_package" from the CADRE Marketplace. [https://cadre.iu.edu/gateway/rac](https://cadre.iu.edu/gateway/rac)
{: .prereq}

## Notebooks
Notebooks and source code will be automatically downloaded to your personal Jupyter Notebook. They can also be found at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iuni-cadre/AlphaDemoCode).

The first notebook illustrates network and word cloud visualizations. 
```
Notebook:  AlphaDemoCode/Demo 02/Part1.ipynb
```

The second notebook Demonstrates more advanced intreactive visualizations.
```
Notebook:  AlphaDemoCode/Demo 02/Part2.ipynb
```
## CADRE packages and tools
All packages, tools and archives can be accessed from the CADRE Marketplace. [https://cadre.iu.edu/gateway/rac](https://cadre.iu.edu/gateway/rac)

The following package will reproduce the network and word cloud visualizations using prepared data.
```
Package:  demo02-public-all-default
```

Use the following public tool to create new packages for your own query results.
```
Tool:  demo02-public
```

> ## Current limitations
>- Only Microsoft Academic Graph data is compatible with this demo
>- Refine your query size for better visulization results (only papers after 2017 will be included for size control)
>- Public sharing of user tools, archives and packages will be enabled later
>- Advanced visualizations in Notebook Part2.ipynb currently cannot be containerized into CADRE packages or tools

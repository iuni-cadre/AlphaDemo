The Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE) will release the alpha version of its platform today in tandem with its major workshop that will show researchers from any institution how to access and test the free tier of the platform. 

CADRE’s cloud-based platform provides sustainable, affordable, and standardized text- and data-mining services for licensed big datasets, as well as open and non-consumptive datasets too large or unwieldy to work with in existing research library environments. CADRE is currently seeded with the Web of Science (paid tier), Microsoft Academic Graph, and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office datasets.

The $2 million project began in 2018 with a two-year National Leadership grant from the Institute For Museum and Library Services. CADRE is led by Indiana University Libraries, in partnership with the Indiana University Network Science Institute, and the Big Ten Academic Alliance.

CADRE’s core leadership team includes CADRE Director Jamie V. Wittenberg (IU Libraries) and CADRE Co-Directors Patricia L. Mabry (HealthPartners Institute), Valentin Pentchev (IU Network Science Institute), Xiaoran Yan (IU Network Science Institute), and Robert Van Rennes (Big Ten Academic Alliance).

“Those who attended our CADRE tutorial at the ISSI conference in Rome last Fall will see a lot of familiar content, as well as some new features and product enhancements, such as package creation,“ noted Mabry, one of CADRE’s Co-Directors.

CADRE’s alpha testers will be asked to provide feedback on the platform’s functionality, which is crucial for informing CADRE’s continued development and ensuring the platform meets the needs of the broad community of users it is intended to serve.

“While we learned a lot from our close collaboration with the fellows, we are eager for feedback from a broader audience, and that’s why we are doing an open release with the alpha version of the platform,” said Yan, who oversees the team’s interactions with CADRE Fellows.

The CADRE team will continue to provide intensive support to its CADRE Fellows—the original, interdisciplinary group of researchers who provided use cases to the CADRE team by using the platform to advance their research.Fellows will begin presenting webinars on their work in March.

# Standard Files

When the lesson repository is first created,
the initial author should create a `README.md` file containing
a one-line explanation of the lesson's purpose.

The [lesson template]({{ site.template_repo }}) provides the following files
which should *not* be modified:

*   `CONDUCT.md`: the code of conduct.
*   `LICENSE.md`: the lesson license.
*   `Makefile`: commands for previewing the site, cleaning up junk, etc.
